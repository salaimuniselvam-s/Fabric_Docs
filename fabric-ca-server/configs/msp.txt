In Hyperledger Fabric, MSP (Membership Service Provider) is responsible for managing the digital identities of members in the network. When an organization joins a Fabric network, it creates an MSP that contains several cryptographic materials and certificates that are used to authenticate and authorize transactions.

Here are the meanings of the different cryptographic materials and certificates in an MSP:

admincerts: This folder contains the X.509 certificates of the administrators in the organization. These certificates are used to sign transactions and other administrative operations.

cacerts: This folder contains the root and intermediate CA (Certificate Authority) certificates that are used to validate the digital certificates of other members in the network.

keystore: This folder contains the private keys of the members in the organization. These private keys are used to sign transactions and other operations. (private Key)

signcerts: This folder contains the X.509 certificates of the members in the organization. These certificates are used to authenticate the identity of the members. (public Key)

tlscacerts: This folder contains the root and intermediate CA certificates that are used to establish a secure TLS (Transport Layer Security) connection between nodes in the network.

In summary, these cryptographic materials and certificates are used to establish trust and authenticate the identity of the members in a Hyperledger Fabric network.
